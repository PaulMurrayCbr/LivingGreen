Lights for "Living Green" art installation.

The client has some LED strings and intends to create an art piece for the "Living Green" 
festival here in Canbera. The concept is that the lights will protray tides in the ocean.

The LED strings, as it happens, use the Adafruit chip and so I can drive them using the regular neopixel library. 
Slightly different ordering of the RGB components, but that's no trouble.

The code produces ... an effect. Whether ot not it is the effect we want is an entirely different issue, and we won't really know until the lights are actually installed andn it's running.
